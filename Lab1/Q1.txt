Summary of the Task:
You are given:
- An integer n (number of items).
- An array of integers arr[] (weights of items).

Goal:
Sort the array using the minimum number of swaps and return that number.

---

Example:

Input:

4  
2 5 3 1


Sorted form:  
1 2 3 5

To achieve this from 2 5 3 1, you can do 2 swaps:
- Swap 5 and 1 → 2 1 3 5
- Swap 2 and 1 → 1 2 3 5

So the output is:

2
